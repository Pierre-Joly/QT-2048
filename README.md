# 2048 Game in C++

This is a implementation of the popular 2048 game, written in C++, using Qt Creator for creating the user interface. Players can use arrow keys to move the tiles on a 4x4 grid. When two tiles with the same number touch, they merge into one, doubling their value. The objective of the game is to create a tile with the value of 2048.
